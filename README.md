Brief note about what this is

## Social Engineering
In social engineering there are many different forms of attacks. These specific types of attacks are a non-technical way of gaining access to resources that would otherwise be unobtainable. There are many different types of social engineering attacks but the primary ones that are important to be wary of are as follows:
### Phishing Attacks
Phishing is a broad term used to describe **an attacker sending a text or email containing a link that tries to coerce the user into entering personal information for the attacker to steal**. When dealing with possible phishing attacks, it is important to be on the lookout for the following things:
  - Graphics that are slightly "off"
  - Pretexting: An attacker trying to create a situation that will coerce you into clicking the link. (Your debit card has been charged $500! Click this link to contest the payment.)
  - Use of typosquatting: An attacker using www[.]google[.]con instead of www[.]google[.]com
  - Email header: Ensure the person that has sent the email is known or from a trusted background.
### Pharming Attacks
Pharming is a social engineering **attack where a legit website is redirected to a bogus site**. This is usually done through either a poisoned DNS server or a vulnerability on the client side. This form of attack is often combined with phishing to harvest credentials from a large group of people. It is very difficult for anti-malware to stop and often appears completely legit to the users.
### Vishing
Vishing, similar to phising, is a way for an attacker to get credentials from the target by coercing the information out of them. However, unlike phishing, this is done over the phone or voicemail instead of through a text or email. In these attacks, called ID spoofing is extremely common so it can be hard to determine whether the number is real or fake. These calls can be masked as anything, whether it be security checks or even bank updates. One of the most important things to remember about vishing prevention is that you should never give personal information to someone who calls **you**. If you need to give information over the phone, make sure that you are calling **them** or, at the *very* least, double check the caller to try and verify who you are talking to.
### Smishing
Smishing is a subset of phishing that is done over specifically SMS. Similar to vishing, spoofing the number the text is being sent from is extremely common.
### Dumpster Diving
While this is a tactic for reconnaissance rather than an actual attack, it is still important to mention. Important information can be thrown out in the trash where future attackers can find important details to use in their later attacks. Dumpster diving is often done either at the end of the month or at the end of the quarter and is also done in alignment with the trash pickup schedule. This is completely legal in the United States as a whole, but local laws may have stricter rules to follow. In general, if it is in the trash, no one owns it. The main exception is dumpsters on private property, as laws cannot be broken to get *to* the dumpster. To combat dumpster diving, it is important to **shred documents with sensitive information** and to **keep dumpsters under lock and key and/or fenced off.**
### General Notes about Social Engineering
Attackers often spend time gathering info on the specific victim. They will look at social media, corporate sites, etc. to try and build a believable pretext in relation to:
  - Where you work
  - Recent transactions
  - Where you bank
  - Your family and friends
When a target is specifically chosen for a phishing attack, it is often referred to as **Spear Phishing**. Spear Phishing of a high profile target with higher levels of access (such as a CEO or CFO since these targets would have direct access to the corporate bank account) is referred to as **Whaling**.
